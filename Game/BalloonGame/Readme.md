# This is not actually a balloon game. :)
A little simple turtle game I made for CS455. Model and texture of turtle done by Luis Cuevas: http://www.blendswap.com/blends/animals/hugo/.
Game waas made in Blender and Unity.

## The story:
You are an elementry school teacher. Your students have escaped the playground and are running amuck in the ocean. You have a little over a minute to collect all of them by running into them, and taking back to the school (which is in the bottom-right corner of the playing area).  
Good luck! Don't loose your job!
